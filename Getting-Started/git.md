## Example workflows

* Clone a repo: `git clone [url]`
* Make some changes (after you have edited files or folders):
  * Stage every altered file for commit: `git add [path to changed/new files and folders]`
  * Create a commit: `git commit`
  * Push all local commits to the remote repository: `git push`
* Branching
  * Create a branch: `?`
  * Checkout/switch to a branch: `?`
