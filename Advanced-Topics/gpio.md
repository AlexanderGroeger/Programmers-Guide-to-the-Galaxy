# GPIO Board
#### Can't believe it isn't USB

### What is it?
The GPIO Board is a structure that you probably don't see on many computers. GPIO Pins are General Purpose Input Output Pins, which are physically available to you as hardwareon devices that have them. For isntance, a Raspberry PI has one!

There are a lot of pins which might make finding device-specific documentation a requirement.

Just some of the highlights for what you can access with the PI example from above:
* 3 and 5 Volt Output
* HIGH and LOW Voltage Input
* Pulse-Width Modulation Input
* I2C Data and Clock
* Serial Pins
* Serial Peripheral Interface

### So what?
What do you mean so what?

The GPIO Board gives you the ability to input / output data as a physical electric current to / from the device. This means gadgets like temperature sensors and motors can be attached directly and operated. Additionally, more advanced microelectronics like an Arduino can be attached. If you wanted to get real tricky, you can even attach other devices with GPIO Boards!

### Where do you go from here?
