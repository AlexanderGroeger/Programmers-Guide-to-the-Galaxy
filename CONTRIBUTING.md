## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies, and any tokens/private keys are removed when doing a 
   build.
2. Update the README.md and other documentation with details of changes, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Getting up to speed
Document how a new user might get up to speed on this project.  Be sure to outline any useful resources for 
learning key tools or technologies that are required knowledge for the project.  This section will likely
need to be written for each project.

In this project, the purpose itself is to get up to speed.  So first you should check out the `ARCHITECTURE.md`
file to get a feel for what information this repository has, then head over to `Getting-Started/` and make sure 
you have a good working knowledge of everything in that folder.  From that point on check the README info in the
Issues and Projects tabs on github, then you should be good to start working on other projects!  
So long and thanks for all the [fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell)!
