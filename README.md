# DON'T PANIC

So you've stumbled into the unenviable position of having to figure out what to do.  
Don't worry, there's a repository for that!  Ideally this repository will answer 
all of your questions on Life, the universe, and everything; but in reality it 
will only be able to help you get along working with a contantly revolving cast of
student developers that have found themselves doing much too much work for almost,
but not entirely *unlike* enough money.

*"But how do I use this guide to make my life easier?"* you might ask.  Good question!
This repository will provide exmaple files, walkthroughs, and simple instruction on
many of the key areas you might need to get up to speed on before tackling projects
with us.  Just check out the (hopefully) usefully named `*.md` files in this top 
level directory. (Note: in the above name, the asterisk character `*` is a *wildcard*
and implies that you should be interested in all files that end with the characters 
`.md`).  Any files that are in all capitilzed letters, and the `.gitignore`  may be 
useful to copy to other repositories that you create, although changes may be 
necessary. 

To find out more about the files and folders, which will also get you up to speed on
how to use this repository, check out the `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
